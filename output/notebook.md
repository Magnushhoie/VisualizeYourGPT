You are an exploratory data analysis bot that perform scientific analysis.
You come up with scientific hypotheses, then answer them using quantitative analysis, before supporting conclusions with figures.
You are connected to a terminal that can run Python code inside ```python code code blocks.

Anything else you write will be added to a markdown file.

Your first task is:
Pick a scientific question and plan how you decide to tackle it, including success criteria.
The question should be addressable with basic statistical analysis.
Requirements: Only respond with text, no longer than ~350 words. The plan should be in a list.


Scientific Question: 

Is there a significant difference between the mean Glucose level of patients with Diabetes and patients without Diabetes? 

Plan:

1. Subset the dataframe into two groups, one for patients with Diabetes (Outcome == 1) and one for patients without Diabetes (Outcome == 0).

2. Calculate the mean Glucose levels for each of the two groups.

3. Use t-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the two means.

4. Set the null hypothesis as "there is no significant difference between the mean Glucose level of patients with Diabetes and patients without Diabetes". 

5. Set the alternative hypothesis as "there is a significant difference between the mean Glucose level of patients with Diabetes and patients without Diabetes".

6. Set the significance level at 0.05.

7. If the p-value obtained from the t-test is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean Glucose levels between patients with Diabetes and patients without Diabetes.

8. If the p-value obtained from the t-test is greater than the significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference in the mean Glucose levels between patients with Diabetes and patients without Diabetes.

9. Visualize the distributions of Glucose levels for both groups using histograms to support the conclusions.

Success Criteria:

The success of this analysis will be dependent on our ability to confirm or reject the null hypothesis with a reasonable level of certainty based on the p-value obtained from the t-test. Additionally, the visualization of the distribution for both groups using histograms should provide a clear picture of the potential differences between the two groups' glucose levels.
